abstract = {Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 55, 2395-2402 (December, 1968) It is shown that fluctuations result in an anomalous behavior of the Josephson current in tunnel con-tacts with small cross section. The effect of various types of fluctuations on the direct and alternating Josephson currents is considered. The results agree with available experimental data.},
